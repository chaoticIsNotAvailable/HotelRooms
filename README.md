# HotelRooms
My own personal project
An app to make a reservation for a room in hotel!
As for now, it has a login page, and a room reservation page.
To login in (create an account) its enough to make a new username, and a password.
After it, You are greeted with room reservation page, which, is almost done.
Right now You can only ask if room occupied or not, which is controlled by variables in program.
Gonna add: Sign in system, Menu with rooms.
upd1: Currently working on: sign in system, i need to fix it.
upd2: almost done with entire system, login is fixed, rooms are here everything is in "LoginV2",
